                <p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>
                <p>Upon moving into my college dorm room, I quickly realized that my room mate and I had a nack for losing our keys. 
                    Naturally we decided to build a machine to open our door for us so that we could reduce the chance of being locked out.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
                <p>The solution to the problem was an internet connected machine with a stepper driver connected to a stepper motor attached to a piece of a 3d printer 
                    that was repurposed for this task. The micro controller used was a NodeMCU ESP8266 from Expressif. When clients from the internet connect to the 
                    Node IP address they are presented with a website where they can click "Cycle Door" to open the door from outside the room.</p>
                <p>Moreover, the full parts list was as follows.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>NodeMCU v1.0 ESP8266</li>
                    <li>A4988 Stepper Driver</li>
                    <li>Nema 17 Stepper Motor</li>
                    <li>8x2 LCD Display</li>
                    <li>2 Limit Switches</li>
                    <li>Repurposed 3D Printer Extruded Aluminum</li>
                </ul>

                    <p><strong>Prototype One</strong></p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The first prototpe consisted of one NodeMCU and a relay module with 4 relays. The relays would 
                        be used to modulate the poles of a two pole stepper motor by using the Stepper.h library 
                        included with the Arduino IDE.</p>

                <article>
                    <p><strong>A better solution</strong></p>
                    <div class="projectImageContainer">
                        <img src="Media\DoorOpener\BreadboardNodeAndStepperDriver.jpg" alt="Image not supported" class="ProjectImage">
                    </div>
                    <p>After testing the relay module method, I realized the correct solution to the problem was to use a stepper 
                        driver to control the stepper motor. The driver chosen was the A4988 Stepper Driver. This was due to its 
                        low cost and versatility.</p>

                    <p><strong>A new design</strong></p>
                    <div class="projectImageContainer">

                    </div>
                    <p>The new design was soldered onto a breadboard pcb in order to make it more robust for testing the machine 
                        on the door. The problem with the breadboard before was that it was prone to falling apart when 
                        mounted vertically.</p>
