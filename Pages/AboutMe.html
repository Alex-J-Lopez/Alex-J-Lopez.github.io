                    <h1>Welcome,<br/>My Name is Alex Lopez</h1>
                    <p>I am a student at the Milwaukee School of Engineering in the BS Software Engineering program. 
                        My interests include: Front end development, game development, and stand alone application development.
                        In my free time I like to learn new programing languages and improve my skillset though personal
                            projects such as this website. When im not doing personal projects, I usually fill the time by 
                            attending club meetings like Game Development club and AI club to name a few.

                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                <p> I'm a person who loves nature, adventure, and technology. I grew up in Wausau, Wisconsin, a city surrounded by forests, lakes, and hills. 
                    I spent my childhood exploring the outdoors with my Boyscout troop, biking, hiking, camping, and enjoying the beauty of nature. I also 
                    developed an interest in electronics and engineering, inspired by my father who is a mechanical engineer. 
                    He taught me how to build and repair various devices, such as computer fans, motors, and to solve problems. He also encouraged me to pursue my passion 
                    for software engineering, which is what I'm doing now. I went to Wausau East High School, where I excelled in math and science. I am a Full IB Deploma Holder. 
                    I also joined the local STEM ROV robotics club and the Tech Crew, where I met some of my best friends. After graduating from high school, 
                    I decided to pursue a degree in software engineering at Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). I'm currently in my freshman year and I'm loving every moment of it.
                     I'm learning new skills and concepts every day, working on exciting projects and experiments, and collaborating with other talented students and professors. 
                     I'm also involved in several extracurricular activities, such as the Game Development Club and the AI club. My goal is to become a successful 
                     software engineer who can create innovative solutions for real-world problems. I'm also passionate about traveling and learning 
                     about different cultures and perspectives. I hope to visit many places around the world and make a positive impact wherever I go. That's who I am: 
                     a curious, adventurous, and creative person who loves life and wants to make a difference.</p>
