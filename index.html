                <h1>Welcome,<br/>My Name is Alex Lopez</h1>
                <p>I am a student at the Milwaukee School of Engineering in the BS Software Engineering program. 
                    My interests include: Front end development, game development, and stand alone application development.
                    In my free time I like to learn new programing languages and improve my skillset though personal
                     projects such as this website. Feel free to take a look at some of my work in the portfolio section
                     or send me a message to get in touch.

                <h2>AR/VR application developer - L & S Electric, INC.</h2>
                <p>I developed stand alone vr applications for the marketing team to use at international conventions such as Hydrovision International, Clear Water, and Powergen.
                    I also worked on implementing mixed reality solutions in the work place using a Microsoft Hololens to display lifesize models of CAD files for collaboration 
                    between engineers.</p>

                <p>I worked for aqua finance for roughly two years as a collections dialer. During that time I was promoted to the dialer one position and spent most months in the top three 
                    performers in my department. I also assisted with the training process for new hires by doing side by sides and allowing new hires to get hands on experience with the 
                    collections process.</p>

                <p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>
                <p>Upon moving into my college dorm room, I quickly realized that my room mate and I had a nack for losing our keys. 
                    Naturally we decided to build a machine to open our door for us so that we could reduce the chance of being locked out.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
                <p>The solution to the problem was an internet connected machine with a stepper driver connected to a stepper motor attached to a piece of a 3d printer 
                    that was repurposed for this task. The micro controller used was a NodeMCU ESP8266 from Expressif. When clients from the internet connect to the 
                    Node IP address they are presented with the website shown above where they can click "Cycle Door" to open the door from outside the room.</p>

                <p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>
                <p>I was having touble remembering to water my plants and I needed a solution. I decided, instead of just setting a reminder, to build an 
                    internet connected plant water level monitor.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
                <p>In order to monitor the plants from afar I used a NodeMCU ESP8266 from Expressif that connects to the internet and allows clients to check the water level
                    using an interactive webpage shown above. The NodeMCU is connected to an analog water detector that changes output based on resistance from the 
                    water it is touching.</p>

                <p>The objective for this project was to create a website to promote myself and display my skills.
                    Futhermore, I wanted to make a website that would let me give anyone a summary of who I am and 
                    what my interests are.</p>
