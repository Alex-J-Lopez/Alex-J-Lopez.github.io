            <article>
                <p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>
                <p>When I moved into my college dorm room, I quickly realized that my roommate and I had a nack for losing our keys. 
                    As a result we decided to build a machine to open our door for us; therefore, we could reduce the chance of being locked out.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
                <p>The solution to the problem was an internet connected machine with a stepper driver connected to a stepper motor attached to a piece of a 3d printer 
                    that was repurposed for this task. The micro controller used was a NodeMCU ESP8266 from Expressif. When clients from the internet connect to the 
                    Node IP address they are presented with a website where they can click "Cycle Door" to open the door from outside the room.</p>
                <p>Moreover, the full parts list was as follows.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>NodeMCU v1.0 ESP8266</li>
                    <li>A4988 Stepper Driver</li>
                    <li>Nema 17 Stepper Motor</li>
                    <li>8x2 LCD Display</li>
                    <li>2 Limit Switches</li>
                    <li>Repurposed 3D Printer Extruded Aluminum</li>
                </ul>

                    </div>
                    <p>The first prototpe consisted of one NodeMCU and a relay module with 4 relays. The relays would 
                        be used to modulate the poles of a two pole stepper motor by using the Stepper.h library 
                        included with the Arduino IDE.</p>

                <article>
                    <p><strong>A better solution</strong></p>

                    </div>
                    <p>After testing the relay module method, I realized the correct solution to the problem was to use a stepper 
                        driver to control the stepper motor. The driver chosen was the A4988 Stepper Driver. This was due to its 
                        low cost and versatility.</p>

                    <p>The new design was soldered onto a breadboard pcb in order to make it more robust for testing the machine 
                        on the door. The problem with the breadboard before was that it was prone to falling apart when 
                        mounted vertically.</p>

                        <p>The first working version of the door opener is pictured above. The first version of the door opener was inefficient 
                            with space because it used a very large assembly to pull on the door handle. Unfortunately, at the time, 
                            this was all we had to solve the problem.

                        <p>After identifyig the shortcommings of Version 2, I decided to move on to a custom solution. This allowed me 
                            to move away from the soldered breadboard and create a custom housing for the new pcb design. It also gave 
                            my roommate and I the opprotunituy to address the problem regarding the size of the machine that physically opened the door.

                        <p>Depicted in the images is the current version of the door opener, Version 3. At this point most of the issues with previous 
                            versions have been addressed. The size of the apparatus that pulls on the door handle has been decreased to the size of a 
                            single stepper motor, the web interface has been refined, and the computer itself appears sleek and clean.
