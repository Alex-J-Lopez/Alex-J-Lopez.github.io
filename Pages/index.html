                    <p>I am a student at the Milwaukee School of Engineering in the BS Software Engineering program. 
                        My interests include: Front end development, game development, and stand alone application development.
                        In my free time I like to learn new programing languages and improve my skillset though personal
                            projects such as this website. Feel free to take a look at some of my work in the portfolio section

                <p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>
                <p>When I moved into my college dorm room, I quickly realized that my roommate and I had a nack for losing our keys. 
                    As a result we decided to build a machine to open our door for us; therefore, we could reduce the chance of being locked out.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
                <p>The solution to the problem was an internet connected machine with a stepper driver connected to a stepper motor attached to a piece of a 3d printer 
                    that was repurposed for this task. The micro controller used was a NodeMCU ESP8266 from Expressif. When clients from the internet connect to the 
                    Node IP address they are presented with the website shown above where they can click "Cycle Door" to open the door from outside the room.

                <p><strong>Objective</strong></p>
                <p>The objective for this project was to create a website to promote myself and display my skills.
                    Futhermore, I wanted to make a website that would let me give anyone a summary of who I am and 
                    what my interests are. This website also serves as a good example of my front end development skills.

                </div>
                <p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>
                <p>I was having touble remembering to water my plants and I needed a solution. I decided, instead of just setting a reminder, to build an 
                    internet connected plant water level monitor.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
                <p>In order to monitor the plants from afar I used a NodeMCU ESP8266 from Expressif that connects to the internet and allows clients to check the water level
                    using an interactive webpage shown above. The NodeMCU is connected to an analog water detector that changes output based on resistance from the 
                    water it is touching.
