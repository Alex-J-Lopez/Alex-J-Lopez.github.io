                <h1>Welcome,<br/>My Name is Alex Lopez</h1>
                <p>I am a student at the milwaukee school of engineering in the BS software engineering program. 
                    My interests include: Front end development, game development, and stand alone application development.
                    In my free time I like to learn new programing languages and improve my skillset though personal
                     projects such as this website. Feel free to take a look at some of my work in the portfolio section

                <h2>AR/VR application developer - L & S Electric, INC.</h2>
                <p>I developed stand alone vr applications for the marketing team to use at international conventions such as Hydrovision International, Clear Water, and Powergen.
                    I also worked on implementing mixed reality solutions in the work place using a Microsoft Hololens to display lifesize models of CAD files for collaboration

                <h2>Collections Dialer - Aqua Finance INC.</h2>
                <p>I worked for aqua finance for roughly two years as a collections dialer. During that time I was promoted to the dialer one position and spent most months in the top three 
                    performers in my department. I also assisted with the training process for new hires by doing side by sides and allowing new hires to get hands on experience with the 
                    collections process.</p>
